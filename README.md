## Description

This plugin is a very opinionated approach to MIDI recording where every message is captured in a sample-accurate way, like you would record audio.

There is no MIDI note editing, no quantizing, no individual CC tweaking, nothing that you wouldn't do with audio without Melodyne. Instead, playback of very expressive and ultra-dense MIDI streams is perfectly stored and reproduced exactly as it was played.

The controls are purposefully very simple and it's really quick to record and playback your MIDI MPE performance.
