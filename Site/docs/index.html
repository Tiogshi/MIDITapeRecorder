  <p>Once you understand how to connect MIDI Tape Recorder (MTR) to your gear and plugins, and what the buttons do, you should not have to read it again. MTR was designed to be fun, intuitive and unobtrusive.</p>

  <p>MIDI Tape Recorder can record any MIDI channel voice messages that it receives and reproduces those perfectly upon playback.</p>

  <p><blockquote>Note: MTR will not record any MIDI system messages.</blockquote></p>

  <h2>Making Connections</h2>

  <p>Since MTR is an AUv3 plugin, you need to first make a connection to one of the MIDI Inputs, and then another connection from one of the MIDI Outputs.</p>



  <h3>Controller to Recorder to Synth</h3>

  <p>Typically you will connect a physical MIDI Controller (like LinnStrument) or a MIDI Controller App (like GeoShred) to a MIDI Input and connect a MIDI Synthesizer (like Animoog Z, Model 15, Minimoog Model D) to a MIDI Output.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="mtr_connection_1.png" alt="MTR Connection 1" style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 73%; height:auto;" /></p>  

  <p>In order to hear what you're playing on the Controller, you'll have to enable Input Monitor for the appropriate track in MIDI Tape Recorder. This passes the MIDI that's received immediately through to the output, even when MTR is not playing.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="input_monitor_enabled.png" alt="Input Monitor Enabled" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <p>To verify that MIDI is being received and sent correctly, you can play your controller and check the activity lights inside MTR on left and right edge of each track. If they flicker green, MIDI is going through correctly.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="activity_lights_in_out.png" alt="Activity Lights Both Sides" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <p>Each DAW and plugin host has their own way of making MIDI connections, please refer to the manual of your preferred host for details.</p>

  <p>As an example, this is what the MIDI routing could look like inside the AUM host on iOS.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="routing_aum_1.png" alt="Routing AUM 1" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>



  <h3>Synths that are also controllers</h3>

  <p>Some plugins can both act as MIDI Controllers and MIDI Synthesizers (like Animoog Z), in that case you can connect the same plugin to both the MTR MIDI Input and Output.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="mtr_connection_2.png" alt="MTR Connection 2" style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 50%; height:auto;" /></p>  

  <p>Now, make sure to disable Input Monitor for the appropriate track in MTR because otherwise similar messages will be used twice by the same synthesizer, which can lead to unexpected results.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="input_monitor_disabled.png" alt="Input Monitor Disabled" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <p>Each DAW and plugin host has their own way of making MIDI connections, please refer to the manual of your preferred host for details.</p>

  <p>As an example, this is what the MIDI routing could look like inside the AUM host on iOS.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="routing_aum_2.png" alt="Routing AUM 2" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>



  <h3>Multiple MIDI input connections</h3>

  <p>MIDI Tape Recorder supports a newer AUv3 feature where multiple virtual MIDI Input cables can be used for a single plugin. As of this writing the only host that supports this is AUM v1.4.0 beta and later.</p>

  <p>When your host supports multiple input cables, MIDI Tape Recorder has four independent MIDI Input ports available for connection.</p>

  <p>By tapping on the <em>1 ▶︎ 4</em> toggle button, you can change it to <em>4 ▶︎ 4</em> and have MIDI Tape Recorder use the four MIDI input ports.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="routing_4_to_4.png" alt="Routing 4 To 4 Illustration" style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 42%; height:auto;" /></p>  

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="route_4_to_4_active.png" alt="Routing 4 to 4" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <p>Tapping <em>4 ▶︎ 4</em> will change it back to  <em>1 ▶︎ 4</em> and MIDI Tape Recorder will go back to only using one MIDI Input port.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="routing_1_to_4.png" alt="Routing 1 To 4 Illustration" style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 42%; height:auto;" /></p>  

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="route_1_to_4_active.png" alt="Routing 1 to 4" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <p>By using the four separate inputs you can keep different controllers connected and routed to dedicated synth plugins. However when routing the first input to all four tracks, the same controller can easily be used for all the synths you're recording. It's really up to you to decide which configuration is the most appropriate for what you're trying to achieve, they both are useful.</p>


  <hr />


  <h2>Make a Recording</h2>

  <p>Now that everything is connected and that you've verified that the input activity lights are working, press Record Enable on a track and press Record Arm in the toolbar.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="record_armed.png" alt="Record Armed" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <p>As soon as you start playing on your controller or press the Play button in the toolbar, MIDI Tape Recorder will record your performance.</p>

  <p><blockquote>Note: you can also press Play in your host and MIDI Tape Recorder will automatically start recording at the same time.</blockquote></p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="recording.png" alt="Recording Active" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <p>When you're done, press the Play button to stop recording and press Play again to hear what you've recorded, or press the Repeat button while recording to immediately start looping in case you want to play or record over it with another synth.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="playback.png" alt="Playback After Recording" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>


  <hr />


  <h2>MPE Support</h2>

  <p>MIDI Tape Recorder was designed specifically for MPE controllers and MPE synthesizers.</p>

  <p>Not only does MTR preserve the exact timing and order of all the MIDI messages, it also provides support for the standard MPE Configuration Message (MCM) and MIDI RPN 0 Pitch Bend Sensitivity message.</p>

  <p>When a track is set to Record Enable, any MCM and RPN 0 message that's received, will be remembered. When this is the case, MTR will display an MPE Indicator button in the top-left corner of the track.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="mpe_indicator.png" alt="MPE Indicator" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <p>By default, each time playback starts, the MCM and RPN 0 will be sent to the output, ensuring that the synthesizer receiving the MIDI recorded messages will be configured exactly as it was when you were recorded your performance.</p>

  <p><blockquote>Tip: Tapping the MPE Indicator will immediately send out the MCM and RPN 0 without waiting for playback.</blockquote></p>

  <p><blockquote>Note: MPE zone details can be displayed in the MPE indicator by enabling this in the settings.</blockquote></p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="mpe_indicator_details.png" alt="MPE Indicator Details" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <h3>Sending the MCM from your controller</h3>

  <p>Every MPE compliant device is required to support the MPE Configuration Message. Each controller has its own way of enabling and sending out the MCM.</p>

  <p>Below are two examples, check the manual of your controller to know how and when the MCM is being sent.</p>

  <h4>Animoog Z</h4>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="animoog_mpe.png" alt="Send MCM in Animoog Z" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tap Settings in the toolbar</li>
    <li>Tap MIDI in the sidebar</li>
    <li>Tap the button next to the Output Channel</li>
    <li>Tap MPE in the available MIDI channel options</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>LinnStrument</h4>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="linnstrument_mpe.png" alt="Send MCM with LinnStrument" style="margin: 0; max-width: 100%; height:auto;" /></p>

  <ul>

    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Send MPE config on play:</em><br / >
      When enabled (default), a track with an MPE Configuration Messages (MCM), will output this MCM each time playback is started.<br />
      When disabled, an MCM will not be sent automatically, an MCM can still be sent by tapping the MPE Indicator.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Follow host transport:</em><br / >
      When enabled (default), changes to the host transport will influence MTR.<br />
      When disabled, MIDI Tape Recorder's transport will run independently of the host's transport.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Wait for next host beat to play:</em><br / >
      When enabled, MIDI Tape Recorder will only start playing at the next beat of the host transport, this is useful when using MTR as a clip launcher.<br />
      When disabled (default), MTR will start playing immediately.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Auto trim and align recordings:</em><br / >
      When enabled (default), silence will be trimmed from the end of recordings and their duration will be changed to align with the nearest beat.<br />
      When disabled, recordings will remain exactly as they were when the recording ended.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Auto rewind after recording:</em><br / >
      When enabled (default), MIDI Tape Recorder will automatically rewind when recording is ended.<br />
