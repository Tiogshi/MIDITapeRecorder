  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Overdub isn't working, it just erases the messages it's recording over</em><br / ><br / >
      This behavior is intended, contrary to audio samples, MIDI messages carry more meaning. They use specific channels and often the ordering matters. Recording MIDI messages on top of other MIDI messages can create a lot of unwanted problems.<br /><br />
      MIDI Tape Recorder is smart when overdubbing in that it figures out if there's any MIDI notes that need to be cut off or later notes that need to start again after the overdub. This ensures the least amount of unintended side-effects.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>MIDI Tape Recorder doesn't appear as a plugin in my host</em><br / ><br / >
      There might be various reasons, some of these might apply to you:<br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure your host supports AUv3 MIDI processor plugins, only some do.</li>
        <li>You might have to explicitly create a MIDI or a MIDI FX track to be able to see MIDI Tape Recorder.</li>
        <li>AUv3 plugins are automatically registered by iOS and macOS when the standalone app is launched the first time. Try launching the standalone app manually, and if that doesn't work, try restarting your device.</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>It would like to zoom in closer to see more details about the recorded messages</em><br / ><br / >
      I have plans to add support for zooming in and out of the recordings. However, MIDI Tape Recorder doesn't display individual messages on purpose. Instead, it displays a real-time visual summary of activity, similar to a heat map. It helps to you understand where the different parts of your performance are, but because expressive MPE performances contain many thousands of messages in a few bars, these are not represented individually.<br /><br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Why would you record MIDI instead of audio if you can't edit?</em><br / ><br / >
      That a great question, here's a few reasons why:<br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>You can easily tweak or change your synth sound after recording</li>
        <li>You can easily change, modulate or sync the tempo after recording</li>
        <li>You can loop the performance without cutting off longer trailing like envelopes, delays, reverbs, ...</li>
        <li>You still can do real-time coarse-grained editing by using MIDI filter or MIDI effect plugins, allowing you to transpose, remove CC messages, change MIDI channels, ...</li>
        <li>You can get creative by feeding the MIDI into other musical MIDI plugins like arpeggiators, randomizers, ... (this might conflict with MPE)</li>
        <li>You can use MTR to record the output of generative MIDI plugins and then still export the MIDI files and edit them elsewhere.</li>
        <li>You can use MTR to record non-note MIDI data like CC messages for automation, and easily re-use those sections for various purposes.</li>
      </ul><br />
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Get in Touch</h2>

  <p>I really love to hear from my users, but please be considerate of my time and availability. I'm a single developer working on MIDI Tape Recorder in my spare time.</p>

  <p>However, if you run into problems, please contact me before leaving a bad review on the App Store or posting about it on social media. I will do my best to try to make time for you.</p>

  <p>If you have any cool demos or examples to share, please don't hesitate, I very much enjoy watching those!</p>
